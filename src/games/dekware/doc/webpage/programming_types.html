The following are basic types are used; in addtion to stdbool/stdint types.

This is just a 'pointer'.  In many cases wold recommend 'uintptr_t' instead.

<pre>
typedef void * POINTER; // can just use void *.
</pre>

Pointer to data that you won't modify (that won't be modified)

<pre>
typedef void const * CPOINTER; 
</pre>


When this project began it had but a custom types INDEX.
POINTER is of course a POINTER to anything, and INDEX is an unsigned
count designed to index an array.

<pre>
typedef size_t            INDEX;
</pre>



Text types have gone from char to wchar_t, and back (utf-8).  Most of
the cross-unicode support stuff has been removed in favor of internally
always working with utf-8.  (Really buffers of chars with a length, in 
a PTEXT segment, which may include NUL characters)


This is a unicode codepoint.  UTF-8 text can be iterated by TEXTRUNE
elements.

<pre>
typedef uint32_t TEXTRUNE;   
</pre>

This is a character; many cases testing in ASCII (0-127) range can just 
be done with characters; this used to transform into wchar_t when _UNICODE
was specified.  Recommend 'char' instead.

<pre>
typedef char     TEXTCHAR; // character in a string; should prefer TEXTRUNE 
</pre>

This is a character array; it should contain valid utf-8 encoding; again
being based on TEXTCHAR in reality, it would transform into wchar_t.
Recommend 'char*' instead.

<pre>
typedef char *   TEXTSTR; // string poitner
</pre>

This is a character array; it should contain valid utf-8 encoding; again
being based on TEXTCHAR in reality, it would transform into wchar_t.
Recommend 'char const*' instead.

<pre>
typedef char const *   CTEXTSTR; // constant string pointer
</pre>

A logical value is either TRUE or it is FALSE.  This type could
be represented by a single bit, however, this causes some overhead
when using compiler bit fields to test for results.  Windows defines
a BOOLEAN to be a full 32 bits, which is a waste of 31 bits of space.
I still feel that space is important, and 8 bit values are the 
smallest register size on an Intel platform.

typedef _8             LOGICAL; // smallest information 

I use this because it's TRUE/FALSE out of habit; true/false and bool can also be used.

Since a pointer may never ever be less than 0, nor may it be REALLY
really big, an invalid index may be expressed with the following 
defined value: INVALID_INDEX.

#define INVALID_INDEX ((uint32_t)-1) 

<HR>

The idea of callbacks, or funtions which are called automatically
by events that occur... how to say this... were preverted by Windows.
For some reason - they decided that PASCAL(eww) type calls made
more sense, since it saves a couple bytes of code space.  These
'CALLBACK' functions should just be standard C functions, relying
on the caller to clean up the arguments put on the stack, since
ONLY the caller knows how many arguments were actually supplied.

Since TRUE/FALSE are defined in windef.h, these values must be
redefined for our own use, for systems such and Linux, QNX, etc.
which do not even provide these in stddef.h.

#ifndef FALSE
#define FALSE 0
#endif
#ifndef TRUE
#define TRUE (!FALSE)

<font size=+2><center><U>Structures</U></center></font>

The most basic structure is a DATA block.  This structure has a
size of the data stored, and an array at the end containing the
data.  This structure is allocated by ( sizeof( DATA ) + bytes_to_store)
Occasionally a block of data will have to be statically declared
to a certain size, this is done with the DECLDATA macro.  However,
it's reference will often have to be typecast to a PDATA type.

#define DECLDATA(name,sz) struct {uint32_t size; uint8_t data[sz];} name

typedef struct DataBlock {
   uint32_t size;     // size is sometimes a pointer value...
                 // this means bad thing when we change platforms...
   uint8_t  data[1]; // beginning of var data - this is created size+sizeof(VPA)
} DATA, *PDATA;

<HR>

An array of pointers stored in a block of data is another basic
structure type.  This structure includes a locking variable to
exclude access while it is being resized or updated, or to lock
it from update while it is being read.  There are routines which
work on this type:  AddLink, SetLink, GetLink, CreateList, DeleteList,
FindLink, DeleteLink.  More information may be found in <U>InsertLinkHere</U>.

typedef struct LinkBlock
{
   uint32_t     Cnt;
   uint32_t     Lock;
   POINTER pNode[1];
} LIST, *PLIST;

<HR>

Where a LIST is oriented more towards random access, sometimes
a more structured access method is desired.  The first structure
which is provides this is a LINKSTACK.  Methods for accessing this
structure type include: CreateLinkStack, DeleteLinkStack, PeekLink,
PopLink, PushLink.  More information may be found in <U>InserLinkHere</U>

typedef struct LinkStack
{
   uint32_t     Top;
   uint32_t     Cnt;
   POINTER pNode[1];
} LINKSTACK, *PLINKSTACK;

<HR>

Where a LINKSTACK stores only pointers in its stack, a DATASTACK
allocates blocks of data, and may store structures on the stack.
Methods for accessing this include: PopData, PushData, PeekData, 
PeekDataEx, CreateDataStack, DeleteDataStack.  More informatino on
these methods may be found in <U>InsertLinkHere</U>

typedef struct DataListStack
{
   uint32_t     Top; // next avail...
   uint32_t     Cnt;
   uint32_t     Size;
   uint8_t      data[1];
} DATASTACK, *PDATASTACK;

<HR>

The other top most important method of storeing and retriving data
is a queue.  This structure LINKQUEUE stores pointers in a first in
first out method.  Methods for accessing this include: CreateLinkQueue,
DeleteLinkQueue, EnqueLink, IsQueueEmpty, DequeLink.  More information
on these methods may be found in <U>InsertLinkHere</U>

typedef struct LinkQueue
{
   uint32_t     Top;
   uint32_t     Bottom;
   uint32_t     Cnt;
   uint32_t     Lock;  // thread interlock using InterlockedExchange semaphore
   POINTER      pNode[2]; // need two to have distinct empty/full conditions
} LINKQUEUE, *PLINKQUEUE;

Often information about where a function was called from, often
available in __FILE__ and __LINE__ macros in most compilers.  These
defines provide a standard way to pass these.  These also allow
for easy removal or addition by defining a constant _DEBUG when 
compiling.  If the symbol is not defined, than non of the parameters
will be generated or required.  These are especially used with
the memory library, which may mark the source which allocated a block
or which released a block.

	DBG_SRC      is used at an actual source point
	DBG_VOIDSRC  is used when the function being called has a (void) 
					 parameter list
	DBG_VOIDPASS is used to define the actual arguments of a function
					 which may use file and line information.
	DBG_PASS     is used to append the arguments for file and line
					 to the end of a function's parameters.
	DEB_RELAY    is used to pass the information which was given to
					 a routine to the next, to provide the ACTUAL(?) 
					 caller's information.

// this is for passing FILE, LINE information to allocate
// useful during DEBUG phases only...
#ifdef _DEBUG
// these DBG_ formats are commented out from duplication in sharemem.h
#pragma message "Setting DBG_PASS and DBG_FORWARD to work" 
#define DBG_SRC         , __FILE__, __LINE__
#define DBG_VOIDSRC     __FILE__, __LINE__ 
#define DBG_VOIDPASS    TEXTSTR pFile, uint32_t nLine
#define DBG_PASS        , TEXTSTR pFile, uint32_t nLine
#define DBG_RELAY       , pFile, nLine
#else
#pragma message "Setting DBG_PASS and DBG_FORWARD to be ignored"

#define DBG_VOIDSRC

#define DBG_PASS
#define DBG_RELAY 
#endif

Since between platforms there is no 'common' method for defining
whether a routine is imported, or exported from a shared library,
these defines help when porting shared libraries between windows
and unix.

#if defined( __CYGWIN__ ) && !defined(__STATIC__)
#define LIB_EXPORT __declspec(dllexport)
#ifdef LIBRARY_DEF
#define LIB_IMPORT __declspec(dllexport)
#else
#define LIB_IMPORT __declspec(dllimport)
#endif

#else
#define LIB_EXPORT
#define LIB_IMPORT
#endif
